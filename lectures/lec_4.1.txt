React concepts

--> Angular --> Framework --> more rules and less customisation of underlying layers
--> React --> Library

React Component
basic building block is component

Types:-
function based component
class based component

DOM --> document object model
consider html pages as document object for reading ,manipulating web pages --> brings interactivity.
HTML vs DOM
1. DOM is modified by javascript.
2. browser automatically fixes error in source code to show some UI in browser.


open element for your HTML --> that shows your DOM.
open console and try to change something in DOM using js

document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';

It will change background color and respective elements property.



DOM changes in React

React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, applies only necessary changes into DOM.
