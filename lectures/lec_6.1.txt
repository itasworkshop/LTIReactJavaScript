React Router
react does not provide any built in router
we can use react-router-dom

npm install react-router-dom axios

1. BrowserRouter --> which gives pretty URL

/home
2. Routes --> switching between routes/ collection of Route
3. Route --> individual routes


Javascript behaves synchronoulsy
sometimes we need to achive asynchronous behaviour, we use async,await

promises --> 
//to bring asynchronous behaviour in js

var promise = new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
  console.log("Hello from promise");
  
  if(false){
    resolve();
  }else{
    reject();
  }
});

promise.then( function () {
  console.log("promise fulfilled.");
}).catch(function () {
  console.log("Something went wrong.");
})

async/await --> extension of promises.
async -->
//async keyword
//it always returns a value, if it does not return js automatically //wraps it in promise and resolves.

const getData = async() => {
  var data = {name:"Rajesh"};
  return data;
}


getData().then(data => console.log(data));

await -->
//async keyword
//it always returns a value, if it does not return js automatically //wraps it in promise and resolves.

//await -- wait untill resolves
const getData1 = async() => {
  var data = await {name:"Rajesh"};
  return data;
}


getData1().then(data => console.log(data));
