web application

(HTML pages) + CSS  --> static website
HTML + CSS + Javascript --> dynamic website

client-server
browser --- server(comparatively more powerful machine. to entertain request coming from client)



Javascript

- open source, lightweight, interpreted, JIT compilation and first class functions
- brings interactivity into my web applications


Few Terminologies-
1) interepretation vs compilation

interpreation -- python, javascript

get two balls
throw one ball
jump on second
}

compilation -- java,c,c++

mycode.java ----->compiled -----> mycode.class file -----> JRE ------> execute
