Redux --> "state container"

predictable state container for my js application

immutable object has global state

1. why redux?
generally we have state available at component level not global level
so we use Redux to manage state at global level

2. can i use contextAPI? to manage my state -yes we can use but redux is better option for bigger application and better centralised management of global state.

3. terminology
1) Actions - sending data to redux store.
2) Store - state,object live in store
3) Reducers - immutable , they take state and action and return copy of the entire state
4) Dispatch - methos to update redux state
5) connect - react to redux
6) container - connected components

4. Redux -->
redux --> core redux library
react redux --> react specific bindings
redux dev tool extenions --> chrome extension
